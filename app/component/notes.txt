1. controllerAs Syntax

Advantages:
1. This is the best practices to use
2. Saves lot of watches and digest cycle

limitations:
Can not use emit and broadcast.

Resolve Property- Routing: 

1. Resolve helps us to get data while state is loaded
2. Useful in case, our view depends on some initial data
3. data can be used in child states
4. No need to resolve the promises, it will automatically resolved for you.


Component: 

To pass data between components use bindings property:
1. bindings: {
        post: '=', //Two way binding
        title: '@' // Pass string
	name:'<' // One way binding
    }
2. Default use $ctrl to access property or methods

For Using Resolve Property:

1. define the '<' binding with same property name as of resolve
property.
2. Now you can bind the data by using the newly created property

$doCheck()

Will be called after init and every event is fired. Best place to write some logic
which can not be handled easily by angular or  JS.

$onChanges()

we can track the oldValue and newValue for the properties with '<' and '&' binding.
